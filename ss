**1. Overall Aesthetic & Style (整体风格)**
A deliberately ugly, naive digital finger painting. The style is crude, child-like, and messy, mimicking a shaky finger on a screen with absolutely no pressure sensitivity. The final image must look like it was drawn in a basic paint program.

**2. Color & Line Palette Rules (硬性颜色规则)**
* **STRICT 5-COLOR POOL:** The entire image must exclusively use colors selected from this specific set of 5 HEX codes. No gradients, no intermediate colors, no other colors allowed:
    1.  Black (#000000)
    2.  Red (#FF2A2A)
    3.  Blue (#1F75FE)
    4.  Green (#00CC44)
    5.  Orange (#FF9900)
* **RANDOM 2-COLOR ASSIGNMENT:** For each generation, randomly select exactly *two distinct contrasting colors* from the pool above. Assign one color for the **Outline** and a different color for the **Fill**. Vary the combination with each new image generation.
* **Outline Style (Color 1):** The outer shape is drawn with one single, extremely thick, rough, jittery line (approx. 20px brush size).
* **Fill Style (Color 2):** The inside is filled with thick, sloppy scribbled lines (approx. 20px brush size).

**3. Subject: [INSERT SUBJECT NAME HERE] (主体设置)**
A single, amorphous, unrecognizable blob that barely suggests a **[INSERT SUBJECT NAME HERE]**.
* **Shape:** The form is twisted, lumpy, and primitive. It barely resembles the actual object.
* **Key Features:** **[INSERT SPECIFIC WEIRD DETAILS HERE]**. (e.g., "Square wheels", "Floating eyes", "Missing legs", "Leaves disconnected from stem"). Features are crude, asymmetrical, or disconnected.
* **Fill Execution:** The thick fill lines are applied very messily. They significantly and violently spill over the thick outline borders, completely ignoring the shape's boundaries.

**4. Background & Composition (背景)**
Isolated on a flat, pure white background. No user interface elements, no toolbars, no text.
